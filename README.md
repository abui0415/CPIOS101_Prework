## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications:
- TikTok (Features: easy to scroll to new content, content are ones of interest)
- Roblox (Features: easy to use on mobile, variety of games to play)
- Instagram (Features: easy to see stories of friends, content are ones of interest)

I would like to build an app that is similar to instagram but for pets. Users will be able to post their pets in a section and scroll through endless pet content whether it be videos or pictures. Users can also post content related to pets like recipes in a different section. Some additional features I would like to add are a section with resources to the nearest emergency vets and animal rescue shelters.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

After changing my fonts and colors for the labels and buttons, I didn't know how to commit those additional changes to git.
I also had trouble dragging UI elements to move their positions on xcode.
